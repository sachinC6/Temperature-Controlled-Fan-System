Temperature-Controlled Fan System - Circuit Diagram (Text-Based)
Based on NIELIT Course Day 5: Embedded Hardware, GPIO/ADC

Connections for STM32 Nucleo G474:
- Power: Nucleo 3.3V/GND to breadboard.
- Temperature Sensor (LM35):
  - VCC to 3.3V, GND to GND, OUT to PA0 (ADC input).
- Fan (via L298N Motor Driver):
  - Motor+ to L298N OUT1, Motor- to OUT2.
  - L298N IN1/IN2 to PB6/PB7 (or use PWM on PA5 for speed).
  - Enable A to PA5 (TIM2_CH1 PWM output).
- LEDs (Status):
  - Red LED: Anode to PB0 via 220Ω resistor, Cathode to GND.
  - Green LED: Anode to PB1 via 220Ω resistor, Cathode to GND.
- Buzzer (optional): Positive to PB2, Negative to GND.
